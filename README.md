# Sketch Plugin - Text Style To Layer Name
Sketch plugin to rename text layers to text style name

## What does it do?

As the name suggests, the plugin searches for all Text Layers, and replaces the layer name with the Shared Text Style name if set.

This is useful for exporting to InVision and communicating a shared Text Style name to developers through the Text Layer name.

## Installing

2. Double click the `textStyleToLayerName.sketchplugin`
3. Restart Sketch.app
4. Ready to start renaming!

## Using Plugin

Go to your Plugins → Text Style to Text Layer Name → Rename, to execute and rename Text Layers.
